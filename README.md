# Grouper
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
This project sorts people into groups based on their wishes and certain constraints. Such as "everybody has a few friends in the group", "every group has a certain leader" and similar constraints.

## Background
This project aims to solve the age old problem of coming up with groups that satify everyone or at least most people.

## How is it used?
A Group maker (Grouper) can be used almost everywhere where groups are needed and can be modified to account for almost all situations.
Groups are, for example, needed in these situations:
* Hobbies (athletic or not)
* School (projects, seating arrangements, P.E, etc.)
* Work (projects)
* Free-time, such as playing games or trips or anything similar where groups might be needed

## Data sources and AI methods
This project only needs data about the specific people that are being grouped. The data can be, for example, people that they prefer in the group or their friends but the needed data will depend on the constraints used.

## Challenges
The groups that are made can still be bad in the opinion of some people as everyone is impossible to satisfy. Some constraints can also be impossible or really difficult to code.

## What next?
The AI could learn from previous made groups and make better decisions about the future based on them.
